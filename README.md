# Chrome Extension: New Tab Override
This extension was initially made because when I used the Ecosia Chrome extension, it didn't show that I was signed into Ecosia, and that bothered me a bit.
It did show I was signed in when I went to the Ecosia page myself. So I got rid of the Ecosia extension and made this custom extension to redirect to the Ecosia search page upon New Tab creation. 

*This extension will work with any page you wish to redirect to upon new tab creation.*

## How to Do it
1. Clone the repository.
2. Update the url on line three of [background.js](../background.js).
3. Navigate to your Chrome extensions ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension's directory.
5. Create a new tab to see it in action.
